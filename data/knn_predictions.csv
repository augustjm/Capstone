117,stunning view of a singapore ,going up this rooftop bar/lounge cost $23 singaporean dollars which can be used towards a drink (which on average is about $27 singaporean dollars). it’s a bit pricey but well worth the view. vibe is relaxed and service is quick. there’s ample seating and standing spots but this place can get really crowded especially right before sunset. the sunset view from here is simply stunning. it’s the spot to appreciate how modern and small this sovereign city-state is. i’ll be back. ,50,ce_la_vi_singapore,ce_la_vi_singapore,1.0
6592,stunning views by the pool,this is one of our best experiences in singapore. the restaurant is located on the 57th floor of marina bay sands resort. if you are not a guest at the hotel you will need to pay an entrance fees which is taken off your bill. if you can get a seat by the pool view is stunning from there. the food and drink served at the bar is high standard. i would definitely recommend a visit to this lounge.,45,ce_la_vi_singapore,ce_la_vi_singapore,0.9999

2719,well below expectation,"my rating for the long bar has nothing to do with price. having enjoyed the long bar previously while staying at raffles, i decided to give into nostalgia and pop in for a gin sling and seeing it was well passed lunch thought we could grab a quick, basic snack at the same time. big mistake. let's start with the service which was virtually non-existent.  it's incomprehensible to reconcile the quality of the service we received with the raffles brand.  suggesting that better service can be found at a petrol station is insulting to petrol stations. somehow however we managed to get enough service to find ourselves at a table, with a menu and eventually able to place an order.  i should mention that it was a quiet monday afternoon around 2pm and the bar was half empty.  the slings arrived in a relatively timely manner and were unceremoniously placed in front of us (i guess the staff must be bored serving sling after sling to tourists...unless of course one stops to consider that this is the nature of the job).  as for the slings someone was rather heavy handed with the grenadine or the grenadine was of low quality defined by heavy sugar content. the overall effect being gin with lolly water; at best a barely passable effort. but wait, there's more...the bottom of the barrel was yet to come in the form of the calamari. as we sat there, washing away the sugary taste of the slings with water, we watch a waiter parading our calamari around the bar for a good 5 minutes. he simply can't figure out what to do with the plate.. he looks around the bar in a state of near panic as if the plate was burning a hole in his hand. eventually he makes a decision and delivers the dish to unsuspecting targets. unfortunately for the waiter, the people occupying the table had no interest in the calamari which after much discussion gets picked up again and the travel around the bar continues.  up to this point we were bemused but now we understood that this was in fact our order which following a few more laps around the bar lands on our table. the well travelled calamari was stone cold.  by now we had learned that there was little point in trying to get any service so we picked up the plate and took it for a walk around the bar in search of a staff member.  the condition of the calamari was explained, grumbling sounds made and the waiter and calamari disappeared. much to,our shock the calamari reappeared within 2 minutes, piping hot and with the tartare sauce in exactly the same condition it was when we returned the dish.  clearly no attempt was made to re-plate to a standard that goes beyond the neighbourhood greasy spoon. giving the chef the benefit of the doubt we each picked up a piece for the test taste. the calamari was exactly what one expects if one was to re-submerge cold cooked calamari into deep frying oil: rubber extraordinaire. the calamari was inedible. i wrote a note to the chef, placed it alongside the calamari, paid the bill and left never to return again to the long bar and potentially to raffles as ultimately it is raffles who sets the standards and the standards were left wanting...desperately wanting.",35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

9702,peanuts at the long bar raffles hotel,i took my friends visiting singapore to the long bar on a sunday afternoon.  we had a singapore sling and really enjoyed the atmosphere.  one of the traditions of the long bar is to eat peanuts in their shells and discard the shell onto the floor area.  this gives the bar a really relaxed atmosphere which suits the old style casual lounge chairs and furniture.  overhead you are taken back to the old days when you look up and see normal hand fans rythmically gliding back and forward on the ceiling.   a beautiful wooden rotating staircase of days gone by in the middle of the room takes you up to the next floor.  well worth the visit but make sure you bring your wallet as it is not cheap.,40,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

(we had visited raffles long bar the day before which was wall to wall with tourists - which of course we are too - waited for sometime for a seat and then even longer to be given a menu by just one very harassed staff member who appeared to be looking after the entire bar on his own.   this was so not what we wanted, so we left.)at the lantern we were lucky on both occasions to be looked after by two of the most delightful staff and without a doubt their friendliness and exceptional service enhanced our experience.  at night if you time it right, arrive before the 8pm laser show.   you'll have one of the best views of this nightly show. obviously it is not going to be an inexpensive place to eat or just have a drink, but it suited us both times, and met our needs.  it's a place i would always return to.",45,lantern,lantern,0.9996

1911,avoid - total rip-off ,"briefly will review about long bar since this place is already known about...singapore sling.the historic long bar is the home of the iconic singapore sling. the famous counter shines like new amidst decor that marries architecture and contemporary plantation-inspired motifs. long bar was located at cad’s alley in the early 1900s. at a time when improved rail and road systems brought rubber and palm oil plantation owners over to singapore from malaya every weekend, it was known as the ‘rendezvous of planters’. not a formal bar, but rather tables placed next to another facing bras basah road, it was a vantage point from which male visitors surveyed the procession of ladies.the singapore sling, widely regarded as the national drink, was first created in 1915 by raffles bartender ngiam tong boon. primarily a gin-based cocktail, the singapore sling also contains pineapple juice, lime juice, curaçao and bénédictine. giving it the pretty pink hue are grenadine and cherry liqueur. bartender ngiam deliberately chose to give the cocktail this rosy colour.following the turn of the century in colonial singapore, raffles was the gathering place for the community – and long bar was the watering hole. it was common to see gentlemen nursing glasses of gin or whisky. unfortunately for the ladies, etiquette dictated that they could not consume alcohol in public. so, for the sake of modesty, teas and fruit juices were their beverages of choice.ever insightful, ngiam thus saw a niche in the market and decided to create a cocktail that looks like plain fruit juice but is actually infused with gin and liqueurs. the clever bartender made the beverage pink to give it a feminine flair which, together with the use of clear alcohol, led people to think it was a socially acceptable drink for women. with that, the singapore sling was born. needless to say, it became an instant hit.over all, you need to visit the place and drink singapore sling in this place. the price bit expensive, but if you never try...just drink and enjoy!",35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0
9762,over rated,this is the original bar that use to be located on the ground floor on the right hand side of reception. it has been 30 years since i visited this hotel. i can understand why the bar was moved. you can't have guests who have paid large amounts of money having to put up with the crowds who are wanting to have a singapore drink and the depart. the singapore sling was originally concocted as a ladies drink so that they could feel comfortable in the bar area. they are obviously mass produced today and so have lost some of its original flavour. if you want to try what the original sling tasted like ask your singapore hotel batman to make you one...they are great in the club lounge of the pan pacific hotel.visit this attraction if only to experience the colonial atmosphere and throwing peanut shells on the floor. this is the only place in singapore where you can legally litter..the island is almost spotless.realise that you can not under any circumstances enter any other section of the hotel. you will be politely told to leave.be careful with your drink bill..one couple we noticed got a huge shock when they received their bill after only a few rounds. better off drinking your duty free in your own hotel if you after a buzz.,40,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

9778,came for the infamous singapore sling and wasn't disappointed.,well it's true what the other reviewers say it's expensive but to be honest it's what you'd expect. it's a city and a classy hotel jumping on a band wagon. just hop on board and roll with it. for me and my husband it's our one and only visit to singapore so we dug deep in our pockets and paid the s$27 + taxes you only live once. it was worth it the long bar transports you back to the colonial era and yeah you might be surrounded by other tourists doing the same thing but it is something special the waiting staff are very friendly and the sling it's self fab and of course the bags of monkey nuts on the tables. the hotel it's self it beautiful though you can't really get inside unless you're a resident but the court yards and the few rooms you can are very quaint. all in all great experience.,35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

3448,cringe worthy,"as it appears to be well and truly on the must see list if in singapore we trotted off to the raffles hotel to visit the long bar and sample the ""legendary"" singapore sling. the whole experience is a bit surreal. a mix of expats and tourists, almost all british, inhabit the space. the staff seem slightly disinterested giving the appearance of having seen it all before. you are certainly not made to feel welcome, indeed i felt as if we were imposing ourselves on them in some way. ordering the drinks, two original slings and two virgin ones, was met with an almost imperceptible smirk from our waiter. on returning with our drinks we asked about the peanuts and who had the job of clearing up the mess at the end of the day. the waiters response was to pick up a handful and throw them on the floor saying you can make as much mess as you like because it isn't me!drinks were poor, obviously made up in batches with little care. too sweet and not enough gin. very expensive for what you get, even by singapore standards. some have mentioned the charm of the place but it completely failed to win me over. as for originality the bar itself has moved several times over the years so the present incarnation is just one of a number that have graced the hotel throughout its history. this is a money making machine for the hotel, and who can blame them, cashing in on the steady stream of tourists looking for a piece of the old singapore, which sadly no longer exists. as we left i noticed a couple old boys in linen suits at the bar. slightly dishevelled and past their best they seemed happy enough to spend their time swapping tails of days long gone. bit like the long bar itself.",35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

2042,"rude service, disdainful attitude and no regard for the customer - a blatant ripoff!","recently a friend and i visited the famous raffles hotel for the first time - it will be our last. we went there for 1 drink, each ordering a hendrick's gin and tonic. the price listed in the bar menu was $18 singapore per drink, an exorbitant price really, but as it was my first time in singapore i was prepared to pay that price for 1 drink at the legendary raffles hotel. we sat down at a table, the drinks were soon delivered and not long afterwards a waiter placed a small dish of olives on our table which we hadn't ordered, but presumed were complimentary as nothing was said when he placed them there. after paying such a steep price for the drinks in the first place i thought the complimentary olives was the least they could do. when i went to pay the bill they not only charged me $25 per drink, but also a further $8 for the olives! when i questioned the waiter about the bill he said that $25 was the right price because that was what was generated by the cash register when the order was placed. i pointed out the listed price on the bar menu and the fact that they also charged for the olives that we never ordered but he insisted that i had to pay the full amount they had charged me. i asked to speak to his supervisor and i got an equally disdainful response. he said: ""the cash register is never wrong and that is the amount we had to pay."" again i pointed to the listed price of the drinks on the bar menu and that what they were doing was illegal but he couldn't care less, he demanded that was what i had to pay. after this extraordinary experience i can only say for a hotel that trades on its reputation that reputation is as worthless as the appalling attitude they served up. if you want to be insulted and ripped off by illegal practices, then raffles is the place for you. if you don't want to not have your experience of the wonderful city of singapore tainted by this sort of garbage then do yourself a favour and stay away from raffles.",50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

2243,something you have to do,no adult visitors to singapore should leave before they have littered the floor of the long bar with nut shells and tried the legendary singapore sling in its home. the queue can take a little time but it's worth the wait. the fans may be operated by electricity now but there is still some of the old charm in the bar. the hotel is currently undergoing renovations so the only part you can see properly is the long bar. the drinks may not be cheap but they are well mixed. ,35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

2236,luxury with a singapore sling !,"you have to visit here when you are in singapore, it’s an unwritten rule!  we went yesterday, but the queue was really long so we left and went back earlier in the day today. so glad we did as we only queued for 10 mins.  due to the number of visitors we were expecting our drinks to be thrown at us and to be rushed to finish and ushered out. it was, however, quite the opposite. service was relaxed, friendly and very efficient. the singapore sling was to die for. i’ve drunk rather a few during our stay and they have all varied in taste and quality. this one ranked the best. we also ordered gin slings for the men as they were not as sweet. they too were amazing. we loved the big bag of monkey nuts on the table. our children had a great time having the opportunity to throw shells on the floor without mummy nagging to pick them up!!  i would advise though that if you have a nut allergy you may want to avoid here as you will be doomed!  nuts everywhere!!  absolutely loved every minute of our visit. we would have been happy sitting there all afternoon, but would have had to take out a small mortgage. an absolute must visit when in singapore. will be top of our list when we are here again.

1978,iconic singapore sling,no visit to singapore is complete without a visit to raffles hotel and a singapore sling. we visited early afternoon and had to line up.  it took approximately 30 minutes to get a table but were able to learn about the history of the singapore sling and enjoy some peanuts while we waited.  once inside we ordered our singapore slings which at $35sgd have certainly gone up in price since our last visit.  the experience is pretty unique but you can't help but feel a bit ripped off - i guess they have to pay for their renovations somehow.,35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

3375,a tourist mecca for expensive booze,"the long bar was where the singapore sling cocktail was invented and is now a hot bed for tourists to come and have a cocktail and throw peanut shells on the floor.the bar itself is over two floors and is decorated to its original roots with lots of wood and old fashioned items dotted about. it was rammed when we came in and we had to go onto the second floor where a live band were playing and it was full of australian rugby fans.we managed to grab two stools at the bar and had a look at the menu both knowing we would only have a singapore sling anyway. bear in mind these are £13.50 a go before tax and a tip… anyway we ordered two and i noticed a huge order for singapore slings going out so i rushed over to see the guys make them. they don’t. its served from a tap. i could have mixed one up myself instead of paying a lot of money for a mass produced cocktail. it did feel a bit of a rip after that but that’s what we tourists are for.the drink itself was fine if now completely unauthentic. we ate some peanuts and threw some shells on the floor which for some reason is a lot of fun to do. i never did find out the origin of that.the long bar is a tourist haunt and i suppose you have to do it, just dont expect to be impressed.",10,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

6581,good quality food with a view,"food quality is excellent and view is great. was there for a celebratory work dinner and we’ve ordered quite a spread for sharing.happened that it’s the chinese new year period and we tried out the yusheng and it turned out pretty well. price’s about $48++ for 2 pax and $88++ for 4 pax based on the menu. we had 5 pax, wanted to order the 4-pax portion so that we could order more food but was told they had to go by per pax and they added an extra $22 for that. portion was too much and we couldn’t finish it.most of the items we ordered were pretty good but the wagyu porterhouse was the best! there’s not much seasoning done but yet it tasted perfect. the catch of the day seabream special was also really good, the fish was very fresh and tender. the hokkaido scallop and oyster, black truffle risotto, crispy calamari, korean chicken wings and fremantle octopus are ‘must try’! the finedeclaire oysters were fresh but a little small. the burrata & momotaro, furikake focaccia and asparagus & lily bulbs could skip. we’ve also ordered the iberico pork chop and braised duck leg but there was too much food that i couldn’t eat anymore so was not sure if it’s good. the servers were generally very friendly and smiley (except for one lady in green uniform) but would be great if better advice could be given in terms of the food portion. we were told that the restaurant menu is suitable for sharing basis and we asked for recommendations on what to order. we ended up with 16 dishes for 5 pax and there was so much food left. there was a little bit of hard sell on the lobster even after ordering these dishes, we were glad we didn’t take that up as there was simply too much food for 2 gentlemen and 3 ladies.we had a slight dismay in the dining experience but overall we still had a great time. we were sitting next to the windows and just when the starters arrived, the green uniformed server opened the glass panels without informing us and the strong wind gushed in as the restaurant’s located on level 57. the furikake on the focaccia was flying all over our clothes and our hair was blowing in all directions. my colleague asked the server if the glass panels could be kept closed but she replied that the echo was too loud and they needed to open the windows. the patrons next to our table were talking and laughing a little loud. we booked for an indoor seating but it somehow became like an alfresco dining. my colleague asked if she could close at least one panel as the hair flying is affecting the eating but she replied it should be fine, my colleague had to insist that it was not fine to have one panel closed back.the restaurant was aware that it was a celebration, and they extended a kind gesture of a complimentary drink and generous dessert platter. thank you for that. overall, it’s a great restaurant and i definitely would recommend and would be back again.",40,ce_la_vi_singapore,ce_la_vi_singapore,1.0

3072,peanuts at the long bar raffles hotel,i took my friends visiting singapore to the long bar on a sunday afternoon.  we had a singapore sling and really enjoyed the atmosphere.  one of the traditions of the long bar is to eat peanuts in their shells and discard the shell onto the floor area.  this gives the bar a really relaxed atmosphere which suits the old style casual lounge chairs and furniture.  overhead you are taken back to the old days when you look up and see normal hand fans rythmically gliding back and forward on the ceiling.   a beautiful wooden rotating staircase of days gone by in the middle of the room takes you up to the next floor.  well worth the visit but make sure you bring your wallet as it is not cheap.,50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

10214,"not what it was, but still a place to go to.","i should start by saying that i did not stay there, nor eat there, so this review is solely on the famous long bar/singapore sling experienceraffles is an iconic hotel in singapore, and in particular the long bar, which was frequented by many luminaries of the past and where the famous singapore sling was invented. although not a luminary, i did drink occasionally in the long bar some 40 years ago when i was working in singapore, and not having not been back since i had to revisit for old times sake, and take my wife there for a singapore sling – it’s just something that has to be done. my first impression was one of disappointment. the long bar used to be on the ground floor and patronised by many ex-pats drinking in the colonial atmosphere of the bar and without such a swarm of tourists. now it is on the first floor (so if you didn’t know, it’s not the original long bar that the rich and famous used that you are drinking in!) and in the evening patronised almost entirely by noisy tourists all taking photographs. how things change! however, once i had recovered from the initial surprise and disappointment, i have to admit that it has been thoughtfully rebuilt, retaining the colonial atmosphere in furnishings and fitting, with its dark wood interior and ceiling fans. it also retains the peanuts (i’m sure they used to be in large barrels rather than dishes on the bar, but never mind), the shells of which can still be thrown on the floor (the only place in singapore where you can litter without facing the prospect of a heavy fine!). it’s expensive – very expensive – but anyone reading these reviews will have gathered that by now, and you have to pay for something as iconic as this.despite the exorbitant cost and now entirely tourist atmosphere about the place it’s still something that should be done once. so in conclusion, don’t expect the original long bar, or the old colonial atmosphere while drinking, but unless you’ve been there before like me, maybe you won’t be so disappointed with the change that has occurred. and although a bit disappointed at the change, i still enjoyed it (and, happily, so did my wife!)",50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

9684,"expensive, lacklustre and not even the original","ever heard about the bar that lives off its name rather than what it delivers? well this is how i would sum up the long bar at raffles (it’s not even the original bar, having been moved upstairs a number of years ago).  it took a while for us to be acknowledged when we arrived at the bar (which wasn’t that busy). we sat at the bar and it took some time to be served.  i opted for the singapore sling. bad choice. in fairness, the chances are i just don’t like this kind of drink but £15 (30 singapore dollars) for a cocktail in a plastic glass (without any cool tom cruise cocktail making behind the bar) seemed pretty steep to me. on the plus side, you get free peanuts. we drank up and left after our one drink after feeling so disappointed.   if, like me, you feel you must go to raffles because ‘that’s what you do in singapore’, i’d urge you to either think again or opt for a more traditional drink whilst you’re there.",50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

(neither did their bar and billiard room!???)we settled for 18-year macallan and we enjoyed that considerably. the drink that is. but the atmosphere for drinking sm's is wrong. great for beers and slings. we left after a couple and headed to auld alliance as we were certain they had it. if youre a sm fan, do look it up.

1411,fabulous outdoor dining at the top of the world!,"we went to ce la vi as a much anticipated visit part of our singapore trip. we booked in advance a table, it had a mandatory charge of 200$ which was ok since it's redeemable with consumption. we were eager to see the stunning view and the much talked about pool. and so we went and the problems started. starting with the mandatory charge, i don't mind, i understand that many people just want to come up and see the view, but we have confirmed it by mail and still the girls at reception don't give you a sec before taking and charging the card...so far so good, then you go ahead and order, surprise there is no wine list, basically no choice of wine, for a ""posh"" place like this, when you want customers to spend money you gotta have wine. we settled for the overpriced house wine and went forward to order food which no surprise came from a short menu. frozen fish nuggets, so called sushi tempura(rice with avocado fried) :( the wagu burger was surprisingly good. but then our order came 2.34$ over the already payed 235$(200++) and in a second there is a waiter with that bill of 2.34$!!!!he was afraid that we will run???for 2.34$?a few minutes later we order another cola for the kid and he is back again asking to fix yet another bill of 8$?!i have never seen a place where even before they bring the drink they ask for credit card. and then the smoking area!we were in the non smoking, but sitting on sofas with holes burned from cigars just to mention. than when we decided to stop for a smoke in the area for smoking, since we had already payed and finished our meal the waitress suddenly said that we can't smoke there (on the standing/cocktail tables) because only on the chairs it's allowed !!! and the chairs were full with non smokers!?! the distance between the two was 20cm, and my wife smoked twice while we were having dinner on those same cocktail tables. so as i said the view was the only good thing to remember. the service/attitude, food and beverage quality doesn't match the marina bay sands hotel in shape or form. i understand people are booking in advance and queue to visit ce la vi so it's always full and stuff and management don't care but believe me this being in vogue will go...with this service it's sure.a mouse trap. my suggestion to whom wants to see the view is just pay the 20++ entrance fee take a few pictures and go dine somewhere else. when i shared my views on the place in instagram i got a respond from the management, yes a standard response as probably the one i will get now as well. i believe they have a computer simulation writing those, many word no understanding.

1997,money grab!,"so of course we had to try the infamous singapore sling at the long bar raffles hotel.we were seated at the bar within 5 minutes of waiting which was awesome. everyone was extremely pleasant. we ordered 2 of their signature singapore slings which we were absolutely gobsmacked by the $35 per drink charge but decided to just go ahead and order them anyway. the drinks were tasty but not $35 each tasty...no sirreee!!while having our drinks we asked the barman if he could give us their wifi code which he told us was strictly for the hotel patrons....what? you charge $35 for an average drink and then refuse your bar patrons the wifi code? at this point i was ready to leave as i felt some type of way about the pricing and then the wifi.....not very welcoming.we decided to go elsewhere after those first drinks and all the barmen were busy so we left $70 thinking that was the actual price. as we were walking out the barman came running over to say we had left too little money and that we needed to fork over $12....lol excuse me?apparently the list price of the sling was $35, then they add tax and 10% tip. i was so irritated after we paid that i decided not to stay at raffles. it just did not feel right.i like to think that i am smart about money and that really put me off .will not recommend to anyone. the drink was tasty but not that good as to pay what we paid and the fact that we could not get the wifi code.....seriously ticked me off. i hate feeling ripped off.",50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

9412,"tourist trap - overpriced, gimmicky, and a bit sleazy","was recommended this place by many, many people both in singapore and elsewhere. honestly, it's a tourist trap. the famous cocktail is served for a whopping $29 plus tax and mandatory tip, so we passed on that and went for one beer and one wine. along with an order of ""nachos"" for a snack (which turned out to be just plain uncooked corn chips with three dips), we racked up a hefty bill of $70. the whole peanut thing (throwing the shells on the floor) is a fair bit of a gimmick. wouldn't be confident of the hygiene of the place - would be hard to find food scraps in between all the shells. the place is full of tourists, no local in their right mind would come here. finally, the whole history of the singapore sling is a bit sick - it was invented by the bartender as a drink which tastes like fruit juice but is actually heavily alcoholic - so as to ""sling"" in the women passing below the bar. sounds a bit like drink spiking.redeeming factors are that the bartenders and service is decent, the decor is good and there is an unlimited supply of peanuts for free. go and have a look around, but for a drink there are plenty of nicer places nearby for less than half the price.",10,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

10249,long bar - aweful service; offensive staff,"my friend and i had high hopes for the raffles hotel / long bar, as we were told we had to experience a singapore sling drink before departing. we arrived at the long bar to a long line of people waiting for a table. i asked the hostess how long the wait would be and if she was taking names. her response was condescending, in which she communicated, that she would get to us when she gets to us, that she didn't know how long the wait would be and to simply wait. i'm fine with waiting, however, i'm not fine with being spoken to as though i'm not worthy of eating in her fine establishment. a waiter who had heard her came over to me in line and quietly said that i could sit outside if i liked. what a kind gentleman (i could tell her felt compelled to make up for her sincere lack of professionalism). it was raining out and although there was coverage, my friend and i thanked him but opted to simply wait for a seat inside to experience the ambiance. i had a small rolling duffle with me and my friend had a small shoulder duffle and we had been told by the concierge downstairs that there would be a place to tuck our bags in at the bar. when i saw the hostess standing around doing nothing i told her what we had been told downstairs and her response was, ""ma'am, we don't deal with bags, you have to keep it with you at the table."" i can't express through words how bad her attitude was towards us. i just asked b/c that was what i was told downstairs! we finally got to the front of the line and we saw a couple get up and leave. as per normal, the table was full of empty glasses, peanut shells, wet napkins, small plates of bar food, and the seat cushions had peanut shells on them too. she looked at us and said, ""your table is ready!"" and led us to the dirty table and sat us. i was beyond shocked that we would have been seated before the table was cleared/cleaned. if i'm spending 28.00 dollars on one drink i have the expectation of being treated a little nicer. even at olive garden they clear the table before seating people! the kicker was, another couple got up and left and the hostess made sure the table was cleaned prior to sitting the next couple. i was so offended to have been treated the way we were and to have been seated at a dirty table at what i was expecting to be a nice bar and experience. i saw the manager walk by, waved him over, and asked, ""is this table going to be cleaned soon??"" he took the dishes off, grabbed a rag, and shoved the peanut shells onto the floor (i understand the history of the peanut shells, no biggie), but it would have been nice had he collected them towards him since he was standing and wiped them onto the floor. instead he wiped them onto my legs. as a way of saying ""sorry for your horrible experience, i've seen how you have been treated,"" he gave us the recipe to the singapore slings. big deal. my experience that i had so much been looking forward to was ruined and i would never ever recommend that place to anybody. for three drinks and a plate of chips our total was 105.95. i knew before hand that it was a pricey place, but i have an expectation for good service if i'm going to pay that much. slings were good, but nothing that competes with other drinks i've had. also, they aren't made fresh. the bar tended had about 30 singapore slings sitting on the bar and when somebody would order one the waiter would simply walk over and grab one off the bar. it was a true disappointment.on a different note, the ladies restroom had mold and mildew growing on the ceililing from the humidity. the hotel has seen better days.",50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

9207,where is the genuine hospitality that used to exist ?,"raffles singapore is an amazing property. unfortunately, it's been twice in a row that we have experienced poor unacceptable service from the food and beverage team. first time at the long bar, was a couple of months ago. had the ""autumn sling' - which i would not recommend (!) and a beer.  nothing to shout about at all. friendly service would have made a difference, unfortunately, there was none of that!  once again, we thought why not treat our out-of-town friends to a drink at the historical raffles hotel singapore.   to my dismay, the service was equally pathetic, or even worse. five drinks - slammed on our table  -  yes you could hear the thump of the drinks on our table - and mind you -not on the coasters placed - thumped heavily on the table. next, the drinks came relatively fast ( that's a good thing in general, however...), 3 beers and 3 singapore slings - obviously pre-made and, not cold and really not good. next, when i wanted water, the service staff chose to ignore my waves, when i approached the bar, and asked, i was told...would you like ""still or sparkling"" - my answer...may i have the a glass of the ""free"" water and 3 more tigers please. hmm...i got the sarcastic grin ...of course and needless to say...the tigers arrived but not the water!  i went up to the bar and asked for the bill. (and my free glass of water) sharon"" whom i found out was a part timer gave me and her colleague the ""look.""  this was a stop  (long bar) after an amazing lunch somewhere else, and it was definitely a damper.  after paying the bill, i proceeded to the valet and was happy to see the familiar and friendly doorman.  confiding in him, i mentioned how bad the service was at the long bar. he agreed with me and mentioned that service standards at the long bar have dropped and i should have a word with the duty manager that was right there at the valet area.  again, unfortunately, nasir - the duty manager was cold, unhospitable and even chauvinistic.   alas, i should have not even bothered.  raffles hotel singapore - you will always be iconic. however, please do no be complacent. we are all part of the hospitality industry after all. let's reflect it.",40,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

9629,fun bit of history but $$$,"i dragged my business partner to this bar just because the first mixed drink i actually liked was the singapore sling. it's been decades since i've had one but i decided while we were in singapore we needed to pop into the bar where it originated and have one.it was crowded inside but there was no line so we were lucky enough to get spots at the bar within 5 mins.  but the line outside got very long very quickly.  i don't think it would have been worth waiting more than 10 mins tops.the place is exactly what i pictured- the colonial dark wood- rotating fans things along the ceiling.  bar that looks like it's been there forever.  come to find out- this is actually a newish location for the bar. its used to be off the lobby but was relocated during a huge remodel to this wing that also has shops.the service was impeccable- friendly but not overly so. there are many different singapore slings to choose from. the two that seemed to be the most popular was the original and the one created for their 125th anniversary called the 1887.  it contains essentially the same ingredients but with champagne as the only alcohol. it comes in a very pretty tall fluted glass but contains about 2 mouthfuls! the do serve a variety of bar food- both sweet and savory.the prices were staggering.  the cheeseburger was 39 and the drinks all around 25-30. you could get virgin drinks for 14.oddly- the thing i heard mentioned the most in connection with this bar was the fact that they served ""free"" peanuts and you could throw the shells on the floor. this was mentioned to me over & over. perhaps because the littering fines in singapore are huge so it's a treat to litter?  the peanuts were the smallest i have ever seen-not sure why we thought that was hilarious but at the time it was. was it worth it? if there was no wait and you're going out for a drink anyway why not go somewhere with a history?",50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

3204,"beautiful grounds, but long bar losing in quality","the long bar at raffles hotel often on the to-do list of people visiting us and we therefore frequently pop down for a quick ‘sling’.  a walk around the hotel grounds is a great attraction on itself. the monumental buildings and well kept grounds are beautiful and staff very kind and helpful.  unfortunately the long bar itself has (in my opinion) dropped down in quality somewhat since first going there a few years back and more noticeably so over the last year. the singapore sling has reduced in size (while remaining at full price) and even the fun gimmick of a peanut covered floor discouraged by little ‘peanut bins’ on the tables. service is hit or miss, although the latter has been more often the case with our last visit a fairly arrogant member of staff plunking our drinks on the table after reluctantly taking our order with a grumpy “what you want”? nevertheless, we have kept coming back on the basis of the history and aesthetics of the buildings alone. the format might change to a walk around the grounds followed by a quick peak into the long bar!",35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

8925,enjoying the 'singapore sling',"dear ianthetraveller, thank you for taking the time to visit us. it is great that you have enjoyed the iconic singapore sling experience in its birthplace, where many travellers like yourself deem it a ""must-do"". the singapore sling experience has gone beyond the cocktail itself and it is about the entire experience of having it at long bar, where it was first concocted in 1915. indeed, it does get crowded at times but we appreciate your understanding and patience in waiting.thank you once again for sharing your experience and we look forward to welcoming you back to raffles singapore in the middle of 2019 when we reopen to discover our new line-up of culinary delights.yours sincerely,christian westbeldgeneral managerraffles singapore",35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

10314,you have to go there,"if you go to singapore you can’t miss the raffles; it is an institution, but of course it is expensive.so, if you don’t have enough money to spend a night there you can have a singapore sling at the long bar.the ambience is informal and country-style. the wooden tables and the bar counter made me think about a western movie rather than a colonial-style pub.funny how the floor is covered by peanuts’ shell. it’s not an option, when you get a drink there, it will be served with peanuts, and you have to throw them on the ground. as singapore sling was created here, it’s quite normal that it is good. there are also seasonal and alcohol-free versions, but i think you have to try the original. it is a long drink, fruity and quite light. you won’t get drunk.on the first floor there is another room, offering the same drinks but with live music entertainment.toilets: you can find them on the balcony outside the bar: they’re clean and tidy.",50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

3927,appalling service a tourist trap,"visited the long bar with my wife staying in singapore in january 2011.we taxied up to the main entrance and were literally brushed aside by the people at the front door as the lobby entrance is strictly guests only. we followed the route through the gardens to a very tatty and untidy lift that takes guests up to the floor where the long bar is located. we entered and asked the waiters for a table for two and were told in a very off hand manner to find our own table and sit where we wanted.there was nowhere available apart from a corner table behind a screen. we sat here and advised the waitress that we would only order a drink once we were on a table in the centre. one became available and we ordered two singapore slings. these work out at apx £30 or 30 euro for the two. well overpriced but i expected this. what i did not expect was the lack of courtesy instead of the opposite that is expected in a five star establishment, surely this is what you pay a premium for. instead it was offhand and matter of fact. the ambiance i felt was artificial and all in all a place to avoid.sorry rafles if you are going to rip off the tourists, word will get around.on the basis of our experience in the long bar there is no way i would recommend a visit there to anyone.",50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

9931,"relaxing ambiance, excellent service & great in-house live band","every tourist to singapore sure must have heard about long bar. it is in most tourist must-visit place as this is the origin of the singapore sling cocktails recipe. i was there few days ago with friends to celebrate my birthday, actually the eve  before my birthday, as i have visitors from another city.of course, i have to introduce to my friends the famous singapore sling, which they love it. a bit sweet though but it's just an enjoyable drink. i also showed them the roasted ground nuts still with its shells served all throughout the night free flowing. then first time guests in this bar are surprised with the way we just through away the peanuts shells on the floor, the floor is covered with all the empty shells thrown all over. it's cool, and some of my guests would ask me why are they doing this, i tried to make up a story. outside in city, littering is strictly prohibited and you can be fined. once you're here, that restriction ends and it gives you that liberating feeling to litter without being caught and fined.when they found out it was my birthday, the in-house band sang a birthday song for me and then they gave me a slice of chocolate mousse cake, a favorite of mine. taken either with hot tea or singapore sling, it tasted good, soft texture and melts in the mouth. they have an in-house band, which i usually tell my friends, that the members are veteran looking as they all look senior, but mind you, they can sing all genre of songs from jazz, rock, top 40's and oldies. this place is very ideal to relax and be yourself, sit down while sipping drinks and chat with friends. the moment you enter they will make you feel welcome helping you find a table. the staff are friendly overall. one of the staff there is carlo and he really goes out to chat with customers, making them feel so at home and relax, enjoying their drinks while having fun with many others who come from all over the world.",35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0
9466,colonial atmosphere,my husband and i enjoyed having the singapore sling here on a visit 17 years ago. we wanted to repeat the experience and were pleased that the bar still exists. the singapore sling was first made here. it seems that every tourist who walks in orders it. bags of peanuts are on top of the tables. customers are allowed to litter the floor with their shells. a friend says that singaporeans like this since they can't do so in the city's streets. swaying fans hanging from the ceiling complete the ambiance. service is quick and efficient. there was music playing upstairs but we were happy to stay on the lower level.,35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

11593,what’s not to love ,this bar was a great end to our wonderful five days in singapore. we had been staying at the marriott and i had been quietly looking for the door every day as we went through the lobby. i hadn’t mentioned it to my husband so he had no idea. i hadn’t been able to spy it so as we returned from our night out i discretely asked one of the lobby staff and they pointed me in the right direction. earlier in the day we had sent our washing to the laundry and i had mentioned to my husband it wasn’t going to be back till that evening so when i told him to push the buzzer he thought he was having to collect our washing. you should have seen the surprise on his face when a lovely young guy opened what is a door and lead us in to one of the best little bars i’ve ever been to . music playing and though it was late there were still a few people in there. they give you a little shot to have while you are looking at the amazing drinks list. all the staff are very knowledgeable and friendly. you don’t have to be staying at the hotel to use this bar so if you have an hour or two free one evening please go and see if you can find ‘the other room’ it’s pretty hard leaving and by the way when you do leave it’s not by the same door you came in.....,40,the_other_room,the_other_room,1.0

8917,tourist trap you have to visit,"the famous raffles hotel is closed until june 2019 and completely boarded off but the “long bar” has now been refurbished and is open once again. i wasn't expecting the 40 minute wait to get in with the temperature in the 30's and high humidity it only gets pleasant when you are near the door and the escaping cold air begins to cool you down. finally you crunch your way in over the peanut shells and are shown to your table or seat at the bar. the decor and automated 'punkawallah' fans look superb in this iconic bar but now its time to sit back and enjoy a singapore sling in its birtplace. drinks are very expensive in singapore and even higher here but i'm told to 'suck it up' and order a couple of 'slings' and a cold water. we sip our slings and try to eat the stale nuts but most are added to the covering of shells on the floor adding to the charm of the long bar. when the bill arrives i am mortified when the costs escalate to include tax and the service charge making the water over £10!! an enjoyable visit overall, the staff are efficient but not overtly friendly, i would recommend visiting but bring that loaded wallet as the price you see is not the price you pay.",50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

12950,imitation english pub grub,the pictures on the menu of traditional english pub grub got my appetite whetted but unfortunately the execution is just not right. i ordered a full english and got a strange green paste meant to be mushy peas and black pudding that was definitely nothing of the sort. all this served on a teflon coated frying pan. the coffee was drab like it was brewed from old cheap coffee beans. the side order of yorkshire pudding was fine but the thick stew like gravy ruined the dish.,30,the_queen_mangosteen,the_queen_mangosteen,0.9996

2762,incredible hotel. average cocktail. overpriced drinks.,"dear charlotte and m... p,thank you for taking the time to visit the long bar and writing this review. we take pride in being the birthplace of the singapore sling, first created in 1915 at raffles. all singapore slings here are freshly prepared and hand shaken by our bartenders using fresh ingredients, including london dry gin, cointreau, cherry brandy, dom benedictine, grenadine, angostura bitters, lime juice and pressed pineapple juice from sarawak made only for raffles singapore.as alcohol is heavily taxed in singapore and we regularly review our prices, we feel that it is priced competitively for this unique experience in such a historical location. throwing peanut shells onto the floor is a 100 year old tradition that we uphold. in keeping with the relaxed atmosphere, we invite guests to partake in this tradition at long bar; quite possibly the only place in singapore where ‘littering is encouraged’, where it is seen in a positive light as a bit of fun. furthermore, as the birthplace of the singapore sling in 1915, we have many guests over the years who make it a point to visit the hotel and long bar to enjoy the cocktail and soak in the convivial atmosphere and colonial charm of the bar. we understand that it is not always to everyone’s taste in spite of its popular reputation.yours sincerely,simon hirstgeneral managerraffles singapore",50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

9812,the obligatory overpriced tourist trap scam,"this is supposed to be the home of the original singapore sling, and they have designed the bar to feel as such; but it says right on the menu that it was remodeled and relocated in 1991. this is truly built as a tourist trap, playing on their history. in an effort to bring in more suckers they have even recreated the bar twice on two levels giving everyone that wonderful ""authentic"" feel.i suppose the peanuts concept is supposed to be how british officers relaxed decades ago; or, perhaps they are provided in all their salty glory to make you more thirsty and drink more and as an appetizer to order more food. but, don't worry, if you get thirsty from those peanuts, they will happily sell you overpriced still or sparkling bottled water. they will not serve you tap water, they will not take a glass and open the tap to quench your thirst. the ice filled cocktails are most certainly not made with bottled water as singapore has some of the cleanest tap water in the world.the iconic singapore sling has been partnered with 4-5 alternate slings to cater to most tastes and the drinks are good, overly sweet, but what one would expect. it is most likely mass produced in a jug and just poured over ice, but this is not an artisanal bar. and honestly s$27 per drink is about right, even reasonable for a drink in singapore, especially at a ""popular"" bar. the refusal to serve tap water angered me, the straw to break the camels back was the scam artist style promotions. they advertise on some menus, seriously not all had this, that every second order of a singapore sling will get you a complimentary singapore sling shaker. they also advertise that any food orders will get you a complimentary shaker as well. first, when we ordered a dessert a shaker should have been brought out, no ifs ands or buts. but instead when we were later presented with our bill and then our credit cards to sign we had to ask for the shaker. the food based shaker was willingly offered, the two sling based shaker was not offered. they interpret every second order to be per person, over two rounds; the words per person or rounds are not listed anywhere. the waiter was kind enough to relent and give us the $0.50 valued plastic shakers after much argument, but the irritant is as i stated ""scam artist operations"" banking on people to forget their shakers and vaguely wording their menu, all to encourage upsells. i will likely be back, under protest, with the next family in town; but my advice is to avoid the peanuts, hydrate before you enter and bring your lawyer if any promotions catch your eye!",50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

13611,enthusiastic amateurs. try hards. hookers.,"before writing this revue, i visited the pangaea website to see how they considered themselves. this was the final paragraph of their philosophy: ""not everyone endeavors to drive a ferrari, travel with louis vuitton luggage, dress in hermès and gucci, or fly privately, but for those that do and demand the very best, pangaea is your home."" let me offer an independent viewpoint. i'll stop laughing first. with the abundance of fake designer label clothing and jewellery - glaringly obvious by the less than prodigal hookers wearing and clutching it -  pangaea reminded us of an asian version of 'jersey shore'. who are the audience for such a truly tacky tv show? i'd warrant it's the same badly dressed amateurs you'll find mincing around in this ludicrously overpriced and over-hyped club. we may have spotted imelda marcos, but that can't be confirmed. seriously, go visit the website, then visit the club. talk about over promising and under delivering. it's brimming with people trying so terribly hard to impress, it may actually make you vomit. it is not recommended that one vomits, because the alcohol there is ludicrously expensive, tasted watered down and you'll want to be inebriated to handle the populist dj music. gangnam style crap, ears bleeding as we left. of course, prostitutes and enthusiastic amateurs have flocked from the traditional hooker hangouts and gravitate like flies to excrement when pock-faced business types are paying grotesque amounts of money for their drinks. some people in this club are undoubtedly monied, as can be seen by its vip section. it is amazing how low some people will stoop for a free drink or two. the most entertaining aspect of this club is seeing the flirting and fake laughter. it is somewhat reminiscent of your friend who went to 'hostess' in japan and was adamant that it wasn't prostitution. as an aside, the amount of men with body odor was breathtaking. this was not made any easier by the proximity of the massed crowd elbowing each other to get to the crowded bar. not unlike so many bars in singapore, they figure if they keep you waiting ten minutes for your change that you'll get bored and give up. we didn't and the staff looked genuinely pissed off that we stayed put and expected our change. the door people and expat hostess that took our cover charge were as animated and friendly as many bored immigration officials you wish you'd never met. our group - who had all remembered to shower and apply deodorant before leaving home - were a mixture of male and female locals and expats and we all agreed there's be no second chance for this place. we had wondered what all the fuss was about pangaea before we checked it out. we are even more confused now as we all agreed a night at the infamous brix would be more fun [that is a joke, readers. wild horses wouldn't drag us to brix. still, it beats pangaea]. if you are a rich person looking to impress unimpressive people, this place is for you!",40,pangaea,pangaea,0.9888

3303,the raffles management should hang their heads in shame!,"as others have said. do not waste your money.i expected it not to be cheap but for 100$ for 3 slings i at least expected courteous service and a tidy smart bar. you will get neither here.the fact that a 10% service charge is automatically added to your already hefty bill means the serving staff are surely rude and disinterested.  i find that for the supposedly top hotel in singapore this to be a disgrace. you ask the staff any question or even just for the bill and you are greeted with grunts and eye rolling. dont expect any manners from the staff or even a smile. you will get none.as for the cleanliness, the floor, bar, tables and chairs are deep in discarded peanut shells. we even witnessed the disinterested staff eating nuts and throwing the shells on the carpet as well as throwing peanuts at passing birds.although this place was iconic and a must do please dont waste your money here, you will regret it.shame on you raffles management you have turned an historic bar into a disgrace.

2772,singapore sling,"singapore a lovely city. amazing views as you fly in so make sure you have a window seat lol. took a taxi from airport about $25 sd to holiday inn express on orchard rd ( also reviewed this hotel ). best way to travel around singapore is to take underground train (mrt). you can go everywhere very cost effective and even hop onto a bus. you can't get the ticket from the machine so you need to go to the ticket office to get a day pass. everyone here speakers english. the taxi driver spoke very well and let us know where to visit during our 2 days stay en route to sumatra. orchard rd so full of life and is lined with all the big name designer stores and shops selling things from clothes to bags etc. orchard road was buzzing 24/7. they even closed the rd on the saturday evening celebrating the young with street dancing concerts gymnastic and all things going on entertainment wise. watching this from a street bar too. very safe as singapore have harsh penalties for crime. very clean as well. even though my stay was short i visited because of the underground various places to see. the marina, india city and china town ( ate there and the food was fantastic )beer was quite expensive and the singapore sling at the long bar in raffles was good but £18 a glass. has to be done. beer was generally around £8-10 and some places do buy one and get one free. the food is value for money tho. had a wonderful time here",50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

10155,is it really a must,"a singapore sling at raffles bar in singapore feels like a must - at least for us westerners. i have been here a few times and i have started to build a resentment of this bar and similar bars in thailand and cambodia. these bars are western outposts in countries far away from our own, they are reminders of our colonial pasts - nothing to be proud of. the bars of this sort is frequented by westerners only. i can not recall ever seeing a local as a customers, perhaps it is just because they are smarter than me - who in their right mind pays sgd 24 for sugar concotion. there are good, cool, world class bars, testimonies to the new, cool asia. i am thinking of sky bar in bangkok and singapore's ku de ta.",35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

5908,worst security personnel ,"i had high hopes for the club as i’d heard it was the best in singapore. unfortunately , my hopes were dashed and visiting here ended up ruining my night. it was a pretty standard club night until i tried to get back into the bar area after going outside for a breather with a friend. we had agreed to meet friends back at the bar area and we approached the bar area when the security guy who told me his name is “mike” stopped us and told us we weren’t allowed in. i politely explained we just wanted to meet back with our friends and would dash in and out if necessary but he refused to talk to us and just said “no”. ordinarily i wouldn’t really consider this a huge problem if there was some rule that people were only allowed out the bar that way and not in but the security guy was literally letting loads of people in and out and for some reason only took an issue with me. for the record, i wasn’t drunk (pretty sober - i’d had about three quarters of a single spirit drink in the past 2 hours or so) and wasn’t trying to start a fight. i really cannot for the life of me understand why he wouldn’t let us through to meet back up with friends. when i tried to talk to him and work out why he flat out refused to talk to me. if he’d said something like “you’re too drunk and i don’t want you buying any more drinks” i’d understand. without any reason it just seemed hugely unfair when other people were being letting in without any problem. it seemed like unjustified discrimination. the rest of the security personnel were no problem and were professional. it was simply the one guy who seemed to ruin the whole night and i went home shortly afterwards as the rudeness of that one guy was upsetting and put a huge downer on the night. i hope management seriously reconsider how certain security personnel treat patrons. never in my clubbing experiences have i experienced such bizarre behaviour without any just cause. i understand it’s security’s job to limit any drunk troublemakers and i’m all for this as it ensures the safety of others but in this case, i was pretty sober and clearly not causing any trouble, so it seemed completely unwarranted. overall it was the worst clubbing experience i’ve had and i hope it doesn’t happen to any other club goers.",40,zouk,zouk,1.0

3084,appalling tourist trap,"singapore has lots of great things to do, this isn't one of them. i know it is on most people's 'bucket list' of things to do in singapore. regrettably we listened and tried it. we walked in at 5pm on a saturday and it was heaving with people. we got seated at the bar straight away. the bar man took our order and then walked away as if to prepare them. twenty minutes later we were still waiting. he was still at the bar, just preparing other drinks and ignoring us. the manager had to intervene and chastise him and tell him to deliver our drinks immediately, which he did. that kind of attitude problem can happened anywhere, but i did read numerous earlier reviews on this site to know that it has happened more than a couple of times to people here. so basically, what you get for sin $27 per person is a very weak, premixed sling. if you fly singapore airlines and order one of their slings, you will get one that is at least twice as strong as this premix here. it is the only cocktail that is not mixed in front of you at this bar. they bring it out from the back of the bar area. the garnish was a poor excuse and showed a lack of care about it. yes, it is historic bar from a colonial/empire perspective but the atmosphere is that of of an overcrowded bar full of tourists only. there are plenty of other bars around the world where you can shell peanuts at the bar - sorry, that is not a novelty raffles. by all means go here if you want to throw money at them. it was quite horrible watching the manager tabulating up the receipts endlessly on her calculator at the bar thinking i'd been stupid enough to contribute to this tourist trap. thankfully we had dinner at the amazing esquina (separately reviewed) and that rescued our evening for us. pricey is ok if quality reflects it, like esquina, but completely not ok when it does not, as in long bar cocktails.",35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

11156,over-hyped restaurant,"this was my second visit to smoke and mirrors, after having an amazing first experience. was disappointed to receive poor service from the team. they were severely under trained for a restaurant like this and had barely any knowledge on waiting tables/serving food properly. e.g. repeatedly wanted to clear plates when i already told them that i wasn’t done, refilled water for only 3/5 cups on the table when the other 2 clearly needed refilling, was very unstable when serving food/cutlery, needed me to take the dishes/cutlery off the tray myself, dropped a used fork on me while clearing the table. overall, just a very bad experience, one that was very different from my first. i don’t blame the staff for being under trained, they’re still young and clearly don’t have the expertise to serve tables. i think the fault lies with the manager who let these under trained staff serve tables when they clearly did not have enough training for it. don’t forsee myself coming back here if the service doesn’t improve.

1302,"come for the views. otherwise, watered down drinks ","i decided to edit my review, take back my compliment after a foul service i received at ce la vi today. i was at the bar at about 8pm on 1st december (friday). let me describe to you this waiter who should be severely reprimanded. a short to average height tamil male, spiked up hairstyle, dark-skinned with prominent shiny, white stoned ear studs, wearing a long-sleeved blue shirt.  i reckon he is from malaysia when i heard him speak malay to his colleagues. i am singaporean and i am able to distinguish various dialects and countrymen quite well. i was with my friend and had requested him to take a photo of us after he served our drinks. i had passed him my phone with the flash on. he immediately snatches my friend's mobile phone from the table and slides up the keypad looking for the torch without even asking her permission. what the bloody hell?! do you snatch anyone's phone from the table without asking for it? i had to remain calm although i lost my temper. i did not want to ruin what was a fantastic night for my friend and myself. next, we ordered french fries. he comes up from behind carrying the plate. i had no idea that he came up right behind my head. i happened to turn and knocked the cheese sauce bowl from his hand accidentally. of course i do not have my eyes at the back of my head. he does not apologize and does not help to clean up the mess. i had to ask for paper towels to clean up the mess at my table. the icing on the cake was when he did not bring the receipt and change for a $50 bill which i placed in the cheque book. he vanished for an hour plus. when i questioned him for the receipt and my balance, he tells me condescendingly that my balance was only $1.20 and because my change was left on the bar counter for long, the other staff had put my change into the tips box. i would like to make it clear that although it is not a big amount of money, i just got infuriated in his condescending reply that it was just $1.20 and he does not give me the receipt until the end. the very nerve he had to come back without the receipt and tell me that he put my balance back into the tips box. how dare he belittled my hard-earned money regardless if it is only $1.20 or not? where was the receipt for my orders? i am expecting a response from the ce la vi management with regard to their staff's ill-mannered behaviour. it is because of an utterly disgusting service like this, that the rating for your restaurant is so bad. i was looking for his name on his nametag and all it stated was ""team member"". he is one hell of an appalling moron. rude and dodgy. horrible service and he is ruining the reputation of one of the high-end bars in singapore. i am awaiting a response from the management of ce la vi. i want to know the name of this waiter. and i am escalating this matter further.",50,ce_la_vi_singapore,ce_la_vi_singapore,1.0

3487,step back in time,"great way to step back in time and celebrate your arrival in singapore. a trip to singapore just wouldn't be complete without an original sling amidst the discarded peanut shells, the live jazz from upstairs, and the cool breeze from the old fans on the ceiling. at $13 a drink it's not cheap, but then it's the whole experience you're paying for, not just the drink, (which is possibly pre-prepared due to its speedy arrival?). you can't help feeling a bit naughty though throwing your peanut shells on the floor in such an opulent location. access to the long bar is good - there's a lift up to the 1st floor, and wheel- in access for a wheelchair. we couldn't go upstairs to watch the live band, but to be honest, we didn't need to as you could soak up the atmosphere quite happily in the main bar, and the sound travels perfectly. we were asked if we were residents upon arrival so i highly suspect areas are segregated based on the answer. we were quite happy with our location however, and certainly didn't feel that we were missing out on anything.",50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

4556,great view from this roof top,"my friend and i stopped in singapore for 1 night during our travels and we emailed to request a table at smoke and mirrors because of the great reviews.tonight we got dressed and were really excited (not eaten all day because we were saving ourselves) to be told they do not have any food except the starters which consisted of; olives, fries, calamari and 2 other items.the reason as to why there was no food being served is because they had an event which they closed the kitchen for. then continued to say the kitchen doesn't reopen until the event is finished. our reservation was for 8pm and the event was finishing at 10.30pm.i think it's disgusting you would allow someone to make a reservation knowing you were unable to serve full meals. you already knew you were hosting an event and failed to inform me of this. i specifically said in my email we were only staying for 1 night and that we were looking forward to dine with you.instead we wasted money on drinks we didn't like (the only drinks you had available) and extra crispy crunchy chips which tasted like the left overs from the event.my suggestion to you as a company is to learn how to not only inform your customers about your inability to provide a service which is false advertisement, but to be able to host an event and cater to your remaining guests. i also did not like the staff's attitude as if i should be content with a limited menu and no pre warning.a waste of time and a waste of money.the only thing worth being there for was the view which made the night a little less painful.",50,smoke_mirrors,smoke_mirrors,1.0

3953,a mecca for other tourists visiting because it is the thing to do....,"the raffles hotel is certainly fascinating and obviously steeped in history.  when you arrive at the long bar you realise that almost 80% of the people there are just like you, tourists ordering singapore slings because it is the done thing when in singapore.  as a result the place lacks the atmosphere you really crave and is more of a money making attraction a la disney.   what you really want are 1930 glam film stars, ambassadors, colonial cast offs etc but instead you get a load of people taking flash photos of themselves and their partners holding up singapore slings.  so much of a conveyor belt is it that they literally line up the singapore slings so when you ask for one they hand it to you straightaway.   it kind of takes the appeal away from it.  in conclusion i wouldnt bother visiting the long bar...it was less like a scene from casablanca and more like a scene from the costa blanca.",35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0
13401,atrocious service and ridiculous policies,"i have visited the queen and mangosteen on several occasions, and have always known it to be a pub serving mediocre food and drinks. however, during my last visit a week ago, the atrocious service of the manager and the waitress left such a bad taste and the questionable promotions only serve to incur the wrath of the customers.my friend and i ordered the wine on the 1-for-1 offer, only to be told that sharing was not allowed when the first glass of wine was served and the 2 glasses must be of the same order. this is one of the few places with 'promotions' laden with so many terms and conditions, that leaves me wondering if their promotion was intended to boost sales and goodwill, or merely to trick customers into ordering. admittedly, we were not very attentive to the 'rule' at first, and my friend took a sip of my drink. the waitress aka the petrol officer was quick to approach us, rudely and condescendingly warning us that if she caught us sharing the drink again, she had to charge us for the price of 2 glasses of wine. after the warning, we did not share the glass of wine anymore. when the bill came, we realised that the staff/manager has slapped us with a bill for 2 glasses of wine, with no explanation. it was only when we enquired that she (in her condescending tone, of course) told us that we have been sharing the drink and hence were charged for 2 glasses instead of the supposed one glass (under the 1-for1 offer). other than the ridiculous policy and the rude service of the staff, we were upset that they were not upfront about telling us that they have already decided to charge us for 2 glasses. we had thought that it was just a 'warning'. this leaves me to conclude that the staff there are rude and sneaky. i will definitely not patronise the place again and given the competitive f&b scene in singapore, i doubt they will thrive, unless they send their staff for retraining.",30,the_queen_mangosteen,the_queen_mangosteen,0.9998

4836,a little roaring 20's in the heart of sg,"this speakeasy themed cocktail bar tucked away inside the marriott hotel is a fantastic place to grab some drinks and unwind with friends.  their drinks are, hands down, some of the best in singapore and they offer amazing bar snacks to boot.  (note, if you are a vegetarian your choices are limited to nuts, and toast w/ tomatoes).  the drink menu is well designed, and along with the flavor profile, ingredients, and ""punch rate"" (how strong the drink is) each drink's history is also included in the description.  the only improvement this place needs is it's music selection.  the american rock-n-roll that was blasting through the speakers is at extreme odds with the roaring 20's theme of this establishment and distracts from the overall feel and vibe of the bar. * they do take reservations, and while not necessary this is a small bar, so if you have a group or go on a busy night (thur, fri, sat) could be worth calling ahead.",40,the_other_room,the_other_room,0.9991

2366,a great bar has been ruined,"this was a really great bar and it has gone massively downhill since my last visit 4 years ago. heartbreaking really.last time, great chicken satay was served, the staff were engaging, taking to us about the history of the hotel as we drank singapore slings, and the bar had a lovely atmosphere. there was also an amazing painting in the main bar that has now been ripped out and replaced by a plain mirror. the whole setting of the bar is different, the entire history feels ruined and now is a clinical basic bar playing michael jackson songs, with no atmosphere. i was shocked at the blatant disregard of history.this time, the staff only spoke to take an order, we were seated at an area that had not been cleaned so therefore had to stand in other people’s nut shells to get the the seats, the prices were far more than previously ($22 for a pint of tiger beer, $10 for a coke, $36 for a singapore sling), service was so slow we had to go and ask the maitre d for the bill, it took about 10 minutes to get our change and  when it was finally brought, the bar tender tried to give the change to another customer instead of me. awful experience, wish i had never gone back. tip: shangri-la on orange grove road do great singapore slings and serve food. and as we couldn’t order chicken satay at raffles long bar, we went to nandos instead, where the atmosphere was far nicer than the long bar!",35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

9107,raffles hotel devoid of colonial grace.,"last week 27th july, finally getting to see the celebrated raffles of fine literary pedigree and characterful accolades, was a most disappointing experience. visiting the hotel my daughter and i were ushered swiftly into the bar and billiards room.on enquiry it was revealed that this was it and the long bar and courtyard areas were out off limits set for intended refurbishment. sitting in the un-ambient, dreary lifeless, clattery space known as the famed billiard bar was far from pleasant. sitting in an atmosphere-less place with a other 'trapped' unsuspecting culture tourists forced to gaze at sacks of inedible monkey nuts shells strewn on every surface complete by pesky moths. a dismal experience masquerading as shabby cultural chic didn't fool many! the outrageous price tag complete with added service charge + tax amounted to $61.20 for two drinks only! ($28 for a single measure of red wine ) and ($24 for one gin fizz ) well who does it think it is? any essence of colonial grace has long since dissipated. the once pearl of singapore,s fascinating past is rendered fake. flanked and hemmed in by abrasive skyscrapers,of commercial singapore. the once character full hotel resembles a plastic doll,s house, completely lost and out of place and is undergoing 'refurbishment treatment'. beware.a major tourist trap is being perfected, the authentic experience one seeks is not to be found but move on a couple of blocks and you will find the cricket club ,still holding onto the  charm and ambience of  colonial heydays.",50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

108,great for people that have plenty of money.,if you like roof top views and looking for a good spot to spend the day or night. its going to be a right choice!i visited that place during the day and night. so i would highly recommended. i prefer to go there at night because i like night vibes in singapore.  usually we are booking a table by the pool  launch !music is always nice and different day to day basis.food and drinks is on the pricy side but its worth it! staff re usually helpful and friendly. even so it can get busy at night.if its wed friday or sat you should try to come earlier since the queue gets crazy by midnight! unless you have a reservation or under guest list!  enjoy the night1,50,ce_la_vi_singapore,ce_la_vi_singapore,1.0
2494,singapore sling,"i had the opportunity to visit the long bar during my last stay in singapore and i must admit i had a really good time. i used to have the singapore sling on my cocktail list in my restaurant and i was really willing to taste it and check how different it was from the original one.i went there with a friend and we had a really good time. the location is absolutely beautiful, the atmosphere is very classy and yet relaxed with this tradition of throwing the peanut peels on the floor. (i felt it was a bit awkward at first but you get used to it after a while).so we had a bottle of sparkling water, two singapore sling and i had a negroni. all together i paid $100 from memories. service was professional as well.",35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

3297,not bad,"i arrived in singapore with a few amazing things to try. one of the was a world famous singapore sling from its birthplace: the long bar at raffles hotel. a nice looking white building, i was eager to get in. once up the stairs, we got into the bar and it was heaving as expected. we were taken to our table and decided on our drinks; an original sling each. whilst waiting on our drinks, we ate monkey nuts which are on every table, with sacks and sacks of them in stockpile in the middle of the floor. no air con here, but mechanical sodden fans on the roof, which is quite unique and unusual. soaking up the ambiance, we watched the bar man make several concoctions at speed with ease. our drinks arrived after a while (as it was busy), and we supped them, glad to get liquid as it was very humid. my only disappointment was that my grandmother makes a better singapore sling in my opinion!! this place is a must for all visiting singapore though!",50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

9234,"a necessary stop, but not very inspiring","we stopped by the long bar to have a singapore sling out of some sense of respect for the tradition on the place. although the hotel and the grounds themselves are beautiful the bar is really uninspiring. there is nothing in particular that makes you feel like you are immersed in the history and tradition of a nation under colonial british influence. it's just a bar with peanuts on the floor and expensive drinks. three drinks were $90 sd and that seems outrageous in any corner of the world. i think i expected some homage to the man himself or at least some historical significance to the bar, however, except for the cool fans moving back and forth on the ceiling it was really devoid of charm. the grounds are beautiful so maybe it's worth a trip there, maybe not.",50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

3952,disappointing since you meet only tourists,"i had read reviews warning that the world famous long bar at the raffles hotel in singapore was completely ignored by locals and only freqeuented by tourists drinking a singapore sling. this seems to be enirely accurate.i went back and forth as to whether i wanted to so something so obviously touristy and finally decided that given the 19-hour plane ride, i might as well.i of course had the obligatory singapore sling and while it was fine, the $18 (usd) price was ridiculous for a simple cocktail. there were few patrons when i was in the bar, and all seemed to be tourists.for me, the biggest problem was a historical sign that i read outside the bar pointing out that the original long bar, which had been inside the main hotel, was ""moved"" during rennovations some years ago to its current location on the property outisde the main hotel. in fact tourists are not permitted in the lobby of the main hotel (which looks beautiful when you look through the door). so in short, you're paying extra to have a drink in a not-really-historic bar (which no longer exists) but the name has been transferred to the new bar.in short, if it's easier to tell your friends that you did did at rather than explaining why you didn't, then spend the $18 on a sling. but if you have to skip it for lack of time, don't be too disappointed.",50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

3291,a great building preserved but at a cost!,"i was fortunate to go to raffles in the mid 1980s when the building had faded colonial charm and you didn't have to mortgage your house to buy a drink!the building has been well preserved....but at a cost of any feel for a historic building. it's now full of posh shops units where you pay over the price for fashionable items, which means it's a mecca for rich tourists with little interest in the building and the now ubiquitous tourist that takes a 'selfie' of themselves or spend twenty minutes posing for a picture before moving on to somewhere else and doing the same thing in front of another site.",35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

9389,singapore sling! ,"we stayed across the road at the swissotel (which is excellent by the way). we thought a singapore sling at the famous raffles across the road would be a great way to end our stay in singapore. wrong.  not a huge deal but given raffles is a lot more expensive to just sneeze you expect more.we entered the courtyard bar.a) no service.  took quite some time before getting a waiter's eye to even take an order.  this is not normal in singapore.b) a board of gelatto was displayed giving multiple flavours. so we asked for vanilla but were told that of the flavours listed only rapsberry was available.c) we said ok fine ... two raspberry gellato for the kids.  but after a while a wait person returned to tell us that only one serving was available!  they had to share the last of the gellato.  an ice cream menu but no ice cream! d) our drinks took some time also - much longer than anywhere else.e) we asked for a cup of ice on its own (to add to a make shift cooler to keep amoxicillin at correct storage temperature).  no ice was provided - they completely forgot. so they still had a gellato menu in the courtyard even though they had no ice cream at all to serve to any customers.  rubbish for the most basic icecream truck.everywhere else in singapore the service was beyond exceptional so raffles was very very poor in comparison.our singapore sling and other drinks cost more than any where else in singapore.we finished our drinks.  returned to the swissotel where the lobby bar provided better service, better product (snacks, icecream etc), gave us ice as requested .. and generally provided substantially better service at a cheaper price to boot.we love singapore but wont be visiting raffles again.",50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0
3572,an expensive box to be ticked,"we first visited singapore in 1990 when the raffles hotel was closed for refurbishment, so we had waited a long time and simply had to see the long bar on this visit. it is tucked away in the far reaches of the impressive hotel, and does still quite effectively recreate an old-colonial atmosphere. however, the inevitable singapore slings tasted somewhat 'mass-produced' and were expensive at sg$29, while the service was symptomatic of young, inexperienced staff rushing to keep up with the tourist demand. we drank our drinks, threw nutshells on the floor and took our photos - that's about all you can say really. box ticked.",50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0
1401,big let down,"i agree with some of the other negative comments as this is a bar that is competing with other world class bars. 2 of my favourites are the state tower in bangkok (siroccos) and the shard in london (aqua shard). in my opinion there is no comparison, i found this bar very pretentious and actually very small! you will see pictures of the infinity pool, which i am sure is amazing but this is only for hotel guests, from this bar albeit the view are amazing, it is very segregated from the rest of the roof and there is no view of the infinity pool. the ce la vi bar is a small crammed in bar, the staff had a bad attitude, again comparing this to other luxury bars i have been to the service should be 5*. it may have been a coincidence but the first 3 drinks i chose they didn't even have available even though they were on the menu. this was the last draw for us and we actually ended up leaving. i can see why they do the $20 dollar deposit otherwise people would go up there, see the disappointment and leave.

9549,singapore sling is a must!,"had a nice visit to long bar during the chinese new year (2015) weekend.  i have visited raffles singapore hotel (and had a singapore sling at the lobby area) but this was quite a bit different.  being the cny weekend, the bar was not too crowded, but if you look around, there were many international travelers with their guidebooks.  i stopped by the bar with my singaporean friend, sat at the bar near the entrance.  even though i don't normally fancy sweet drinks/cocktails, i've placed an order for singapore sling, which originated here.  the drink itself was not too strong, but a very nice touch and mix of sweet and sour, surely it went down very easily to very dry throat (from walking outside in this hot weather).  there are bags of peanut located everywhere, where you can just brush shells off the table/counter to the floor.  the price, of course, is high -- but if you think of the hotel (seriously, have you ever actually walked into the hotel and look around?) i think this is understandable.  bartenders and service staff were all so friendly, helped us taking photos, and had small chat with us here and there.  added bonus, is that if you order two slings, they give you a shaker (that actually has ingredients/recipe of one of their ""slings"") -- kind of unexpected souvenir from the visit.i surely will visit there again.  if you are looking for an olden style bar with great drinks, this is a must visit :)",50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

2007,charge like the light brigade...,"if you want to experience a good bar with a decent atmosphere, a sumptuous cocktails list, and all the peanuts you could ever want to eat (the shells of which cover the bar floor) this is the place to go.the long bar, attached to raffles hotel, is situated on two floors, each with its own full bar. the seating is a mix of low tables and chairs and bar seats. the lighting is dim - in one corner it was too dark - with one bright spot on the top floor part hosting the billiard table.as well as the signature peanuts  - with a small sack on each table - the ceilings have an array of fans beating to and fro. these are not circular rotary fans, but a version of the type you could use by hand. interesting. the service was ok, but not outstanding, especially when full. they need more waiters. the staff were friendly and tried hard.the drinks were excellent.the drinks were a fortune; very expensive.of course, you are paying for the raffles name and the experience. while i remember, the prices on the menu do not include gst (fair enough) nor the automatic addition of 10% service charge. (if it was mentioned, i missed it.)the prices and the service - which really should be better - mean it doesn't merit five stars. but it does merit a visit, provided your wallet is suitably prepared for the charge of the light brigade.worth doing. once.",50,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

5925,bad experience ,"on the 4th may, 12:30am, my friends went to zouk, which i thought its the best nightlife site in singapore. little did i know that the staffs in zouk are getting more arrogant these days. bar will take longer time than expected to deliver your drink. but that is minor. i will like to bring up the highlight of the night, which is the security.i was having fun on the dancefloor with my friends. until there's one point when i could hear people reciting what they called the ""gang poem"". however, i was singled out from my group of friends. didnt understand what's going on, i asked the individual guard. he asked me if i'm a local, i said yes. he told me i was chanting. without giving me a chance to explain myself for something i did not do, he barred me from entering zouk with 6 banning stamps.i dont get it. by opening mouth, no matter what you sing along. they will take you away from the floor just because they feel that they are right. i understand the fact that the security are trying to do their job. but isnt this way too much? is this just a new scheme to pull people out so they can take in new guests from outside? zouk staffs are getting bad to worse. from front desk to bar to security. they dont make you feel any welcome anymore. they made it feels like they own the place, zero hospitality.",40,zouk,zouk,1.0
6532,"very nice, unpretentious","went twice, once on friday at 11pm, once on saturday 12am. had no advanced tickets either time. the first time i was directed to the wrong line, but once that was corrected the wait time was minimal (~5-10 minutes). the wait time on saturday was even less. completely fair first-come-first-served line to buy tickets. no rude bouncers, all the staff outside were straightforward and helpful.once inside it was the same. even when the place got crowded at 1am there were plenty of bartenders to take orders. usual wait time for drinks was 3 minutes or less. longest was 10 minutes, but that was a particularly crowded bar and once i got to the bar itself my order was taken right away. i never felt like the bartender ignored me or served people in the wrong order.crowd is a good mix of locals and tourists. wide variety of ages from 18 to 60. i'd say mid-late twenties is the average but i didn't feel out of place at all being a bit older. the dance floor near the dj booth gets super crowded. i would recommend staying on the upper floors if you value freedom of movement.the queue for the slide could be improved. it seems like there is limited space so the queue-minder-person turns people away saying that the slide is closed, when in fact he will allow people to queue up again once the queue has gone down and there is more space. they should come up with a better system for that. the slide itself was fine, it lasts two seconds but that's gravity for you.i have it on good (local) authority the prices for vip tables are super expensive. just be aware of that.",50,marquee_singapore,marquee_singapore,1.0

3238,expensive experience,they don't allow tourist in the hotel so you wind up in the long bar. this is a comfortable place loaded with tourists. they provide unshelled peanuts that come from malaysia which are tiny. you throw the shells on the floor. the singapore sling has so many liquids in it. this killed some time. ,35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0
9361,what a shame!,"my wife and i went to the long bar for the last night of a two week vacation in the region.  we thought it would be fun to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the singapore sling.  however, it turned out to be a very disappointing experience.  first of all, the drinks were overpriced.  $75 for two drinks is way over the top.  the live band was tired and uninteresting (there's only so much black magic woman that you can take...come on guys, there have been a lot of good songs out in the last 30 years!) and the place was really lifeless for a saturday night.  the band took a break at 10:00 pm and still had not come back on (i wanted to give them another chance!) by 10:40 when we decided to leave.  as we were leaving i mentioned to the guy who looked like he was the manager, that they probably could have made another hundred dollars off of us, if the band hadn't taken nearly an hour long break.  but he could probably care less, based on the line of people at the front door waiting to get in.  people are coming there, just because of the reputation and to check off a box... obviously not to have a good time.  i was in the long bar 20 years ago and remember it as a fun atmosphere on a saturday night.  it's not there anymore.  they are content to just rip-off tourists now.  so if you must go because it's on your bucket list, just stop by in the afternoon to have a look at the fans and the peanut buckets (neither very impressive anyway) and save yourself a big disappointment in the evening.",35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

2896,"overrated, overpriced, poor service and no atmosphere","we arrived about 9pm on a monday evening and there was just one table free. we headed straight for it without being seated which may have been our downfall. it was as if we didn't exist! we had to go and ask for a menu which the waitress said she would bring to our table, even though the pile was right next to her we still had to wait ages for her to carry it to the table. everything took ages to order and then to arrive. the singapore sling in my opinion was one of the worst i have had. not only was it too expensive, but it had too much 'syrup' in it. it was so sweet i wanted to clean my teeth and i couldn't finish it. we ordered some bar snacks as it was late and we had not eaten - chicken wings and satay. both of these were terrible. the chicken wings came battered and with a chipotle dip - all of which was very reminiscent of a recent trip to kfc. i was not surprised to learn there was a kfc just round the corner! the total bill came to s$122 for two drinks and two bar snack meals. so not worth it. the peanuts on the table tasted funny and were very small. i happily ripped a few open and threw the mess on the floor though. everyone there just seemed to be buying one drink and leaving and i do not blame them. the price, service and atmosphere is enough to put any one off.  interestingly the original long bar where the singapore sling was created in 1915 was actually on the ground floor next to the lobby. it was relocated to the second floor in the renovation works in 1991 and decorated to mimic the 1915 era. unless it is on a bucket list of yours then i wouldn't bother. we had much better cocktails, service and atmosphere at the post bar in the fullerton hotel. i may have had one too many of their singapore slings as i had a rather sore head the following day!",35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

3463,singapore sling,one of my main objectives in singapore is to try the famous singapore sling alcoholic drink at raffles hotel.  i’m not a cocktail or mixed drink kind of person but i don’t want to miss out on the experience either.  it sure was a very good feeling enjoying the singapore sling at the outside patio of the raffles hotel.  the servers were very friendly and knows what they were doing.  they recommended real nice appetizers to pair with the singapore slings.  for the price of $26 for a drink might be kind of steep but this is in singapore raffles hotel where the singapore sling was invented.  one don’t go to germany and not at least try drinking a beer or two.,35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

9522,nice place to chill out after afternoon tea.,it was a really nice place to chill after having afternoon tea in the tiffin room downstairs. when you first enter the long bar you will notice all the peanut shells on the floor and there is a sack of peanuts on every table and on the bar.the traditional drink to have is the famous singapore sling and all the bar staff make the drink up very quickly and then you just drink and eat peanuts for the duration. it does get very busy and you can get a table to yourself or just sit at the bar.the dress code is very casual and people are dressed in shorts and flip flops but it is okay and no one bothers you. the price for a singapore sling is a bit pricey but this is singapore. my wife and i will definitely return to the long bar if we travel to singapore again. i would recommend this place if you are visiting singapore,10,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

10282,slingin it up!!,we enjoyed a trip to the raffles hotel and the long bar for a singapore sling during our time in singapore last month and despite some negetive reviews we all felt it was worth a visit.the slings were all made on arrival and i think they cost about $28 each which of course is a bit pricey for a drink but you are also paying because you are visiting an attraction too. the drink was nice which was a bonus as i didnt know what to expect from it.the bar had the old colonial feel about it as did the whole of raffles to be fair. nuts on the floor added to the feel of the place. the staff were very friendly and obliging in allowing photographs.well worth a crack!,40,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

10557,appalling service a tourist trap,"visited the long bar with my wife staying in singapore in january 2011.we taxied up to the main entrance and were literally brushed aside by the people at the front door as the lobby entrance is strictly guests only. we followed the route through the gardens to a very tatty and untidy lift that takes guests up to the floor where the long bar is located. we entered and asked the waiters for a table for two and were told in a very off hand manner to find our own table and sit where we wanted.there was nowhere available apart from a corner table behind a screen. we sat here and advised the waitress that we would only order a drink once we were on a table in the centre. one became available and we ordered two singapore slings. these work out at apx £30 or 30 euro for the two. well overpriced but i expected this. what i did not expect was the lack of courtesy instead of the opposite that is expected in a five star establishment, surely this is what you pay a premium for. instead it was offhand and matter of fact. the ambiance i felt was artificial and all in all a place to avoid.sorry rafles if you are going to rip off the tourists, word will get around.on the basis of our experience in the long bar there is no way i would recommend a visit there to anyone.",40,long_bar,long_bar,1.0
2261,quirky cocktail,raffles is a great place to visit for an hour and sample the quirky long bar with a singapore sling cocktail. other reviewers have stated they had to queue but my wife and myself were seated straightaway at 1pm on a thursday. the drink is pleasant but the long bar is the star of the show - a beautiful period building restored in a most tasteful manner. the only odd thing is the monkey nuts 🥜 that appear on every table and are strewn over the floor. $sd32 per sling.,35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

4705,"skyfall is not the james bond movie in this instance, but how the night plummeted here.","it started with a great view on top of the national gallery. good acoustics. lovely ambience. a friend whose taste i trust had 2 drinks over 2 nights here and would only be in sg for a limited time and wanted me to spend time at this place, so i decided to meet up with her and 2 other people at this location. rainforest remedy was a nice cocktail to start with, after the horrible taxi ride i endured to get to this place. my friend ordered a mocktail, and her friend ordered a lager.she recommended that the new friend we had just made should try fatty old-fashioned, a cocktail for the month of august which she had recently ordered in a previous visit. this was made using ron zacapa premium rum, rice pandan syrup, with ikan bilis and peanuts- only the staff did not tell us they had run out of peanuts and ikan bilis. the cocktail tasted decent but my friend saw the cocktail had no ikan bilis and peanuts on top, had to tell our friend, and then she also had to tell one of the staff to inform the bartender and ask if smoke & mirrors had run out of ikan bilis and peanuts for this special cocktail. a senior staffer came over, confirmed they had run out of peanuts, said several cocktails on the menu were unavailable because they were finished, and suggested another cocktail to replace this cocktail. after tasting his suggestion, our friend did not like the suggested cocktail, and ordered a rainforest remedy. i wanted to get our friend a drink he liked, and considered getting him the nakajima dansu, but decided to ask the same senior staffer for his opinion. that was my mistake. glasgow's winterfall is a cocktail of drambuie, amara nonino, becherovka, grapefruit sherbet, lemon, orange bitters and bubblies. it was definitely misnamed, because our friend took a sip and promptly informed us that it tasted like the after-effects of gastric reflux or someone having thrown up and being left with the acidic taste in the mouth. considering he can take apart a mojito with biting detail and has a very reliable nose for various alcohols, and after tasting what he described, i had to reluctantly agree with how correct he was. i had ordered a rum to try, but it was not worth $48. i could have gotten gosling's black seal elsewhere and drunk it neat or on the rocks for $23, and that rum would have tasted much better. we also learned that the kitchen closed before 11 pm, which was not helping when at least 2 of us wanted to order food. then the bill finally came. the bill listed fatty old-fashioned as an item and when we checked to find out why, another staff member had to answer us, because we were told the senior staffer had left work. that staff member told us the charge was for the unnamed cocktail which replaced fatty old-fashioned. it seemed our friend had been too polite in not telling them how bad his cocktails had been (barring rainforest remedy). and i was too polite in not telling them how appallingly unacceptable their service was, so i was grateful the kitchen closed early enough to stop us from spending more money here. my friend who made the recommendation to try this place was starting to bristle and not wanting to stay any longer even if i considered the drinks being overpriced, i paid the bill for all of us.unless there is a compelling reason, i will not return, and i will not advise people to come here. you can come for the view, but for a drink? that's up to you to try.",50,smoke_mirrors,smoke_mirrors,1.0

9568,rip of but it's got to be done!!!,"all i wanted to do was have my singapore sling in the long bar in raffles hotel so it was one of the 1st things we did on arrival in singapore.we were embarking on a cruise and had to be at the cruise terminal at 1 so arrived about 10.30 but the long bar doesn't open until 11 so we returned at 11 and queued outside with all the other tourists for the place to open.the singapore sling when we got in the bar was made in bulk (not an individual cocktail), the bar tender literally had about 10 cocktail shakers lined up and poured the ingredients over them all at the same time, then shook them and poured then added the fruit on each glass, we were then served.overall it was a great experience and one that you have to do but for the two singapore slings it cost us £36 english pounds which is a complete rip off but they can charge it cos there were loads of us waiting for the place to open and as i stated earlier that was my priority of things to do in singapore.",35,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

(this is before tax and service charges). however, this is the original and well worth it. the recipe seems to be a mystery. i think each place in singapore where i ordered a singapore sling tasted differently. it is now great to have the original and have a baseline. i thought it was great. not too sweet and a perfect mid afternoon cocktail.if you want to eat anything with this, you won't be able to as they only have a cocktail menu.overall, you should come here at least once if you are in singapore.pro-tip: if you have a peanut allergy, do not come here. there is a bag of peanuts on every table and shells all over the floors.",30,long_bar,long_bar,1.0

11346,"""amazingly amazed""","i am giving this a 5 star simply because the view is spectacular! really... it is beautiful. you have a superb view on the singapore flyer, esplanade and the marina bay sands. in the evening there is a light show which adds a nice surprise to the visit. it is located on top of the national gallery. to get there, go in through he front of the national gallery, take the elevator to the 5th floor, when you come out, follow the path and take the stairs upstairs to the 6th floor. the view will seriously knock you on your duff. i highly recommend going in the evening for 2 reasons: 1. it's in full sun in the daytime and hot as blazes and 2. the nighttime view is not to be missed.we had a few cocktails. they have an interesting mix of spirits and come up with some unusual combinations:- kurokava - very unusual and not at all unpleasant. not sweet, a bit more on the savory side. it is served with some seaweed on the rim as well as a sweet micro tomato- rainforest remedy - tart and tropical. served with edible flowers (mexican oregano), giving a slightly herbal feel while at the same time being sweet (though not overwhelmingly so)- old & new sling - their take not he singapore sling. tart and refreshing. the pineapple is there in the bubbles, adding a different dimension and making the drink lighterand of course they have a nice selection of spirits for those that prefer a simpler drink, along with beer and other drinks.i recommend it for the experience alone.",40,smoke_mirrors,smoke_mirrors,1.0

4867,great view but poor food,"don't order the beef for 58. you can get better beef elsewhere. the chili grab bun is no where representative of chilli grab in singapore . if you want, just grab just an alcohol and you'll have an enjoyable time there. ",40,lantern,lantern,1.0
